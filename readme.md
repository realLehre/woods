# WOODS

### Scrolling through my twitter feed and I came across this beautiful UI. I loved how the theme, colors and fonts are in tandem.

### I reached out to the designer and got the figma file.

## Code system

### I used SCSS for the styling, quite intuitive and yeah, it's CSS *with super powers*
### [Animate on scroll](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) library for the animate on reveal effects
